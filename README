Installing GenI
---------------
(tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS X)

see INSTALL for details (should just be cabal install)

Development
-----------
The code style has evolved a lot.  Sorry for the inconsistency.
As of 2012-05-06, I'm trying to move to a published style guide
so I can stop thinking about it

  https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide

But the code will take a long time to catch up
