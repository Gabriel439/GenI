-- | Once upon a time, GenI had two very different algorithms for tree assembly,
--   a CKY/Early style one using packed trees; and the traditional “simple“
--   algorithm that remains in 2012-GenI.  Diffrent algorithms may use different
--   chart items, and different debugger visualisations, hence this data structure
--
--   I hope one day to make a move towards implementing the fancier algorithms,
--   which is why I'm keeping around this infrastructure
