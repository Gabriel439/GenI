How to do a live demo of GenI with polarities
---------------------------------------------

(this is a simplified version of the promettre grammar)

1) first donnersem; launch the debugger

     0 - lexical selection - note multiple trees for donner
         now we are in the substitution loop
         note trees moving from agenda to chart (leap 1 x 3)
     3 - substitution with livre and donner (leap 1 x 2)
     5 - and again with livre - with this newly created tree (leap 1 x 3)
     8 - note the result where all substitutions are done (leap 1)
     9 - now that substitution is finished, we switch to the adjunction 
         phase (leap 1 x 3)

     12 - now we try to insert the tree "un" into the trees of the
          agenda (leap 1)
     13 - un livre (leap 1 x 3) 
     16 - jean donner livre a paul (leap 1)
     17 - and now this is semantically complete so we output the
          realisation "Jean donne livre à Paul"

     KEEP THIS DEBUGGER OPEN!

2) enable the polarity optimisation; 
   hit generate; 
   show automaton tab (tiny automota);
   launch the debugger
      
      0 - notice fewer trees (compare with other debugger; close old debugger)
          (leap 2 x 13)
          
3) load promettredonnersem; 
   hit generate
   show automaton tab (big automata q vs q pruned)
   launch debugger (keep it open) - show few trees
   disable optimisation 
   launch debugger - show many trees
