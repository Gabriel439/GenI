        <p>GenI is a surface realizer for Tree Adjoining Grammars. Surface realization can be seen a subtask of natural language generation (producing natural language utterances, e.g., English texts, out of abstract inputs). GenI in particular takes a Feature Based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar and an input semantics (a conjunction of first order terms), and produces the set of sentences associated with the input semantics by the grammar. It features a surface realization library, several optimizations, batch generation mode, and a graphical debugger written in wxHaskell.</p>
<p>GenI runs on MacOS X, Linux and Windows and like anywhere else that the Haskell Platform runs on.</p>
<p>It was developed within the TALARIS project and is free software licensed under the GNU GPL, with dual-licensing available for commercial purposes.</p>
