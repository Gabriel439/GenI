Notes:

(1) Contrary to my initial expectations, I have had to rely on the
    polarity automata to make restrictors like (cleft:j) work.  
    
    The basic problem is that we can't tell from the semantics alone
    which lexical items we are suppose to apply the restrictor to.  
    
    What I do for the time being is 
      1) for every restrictor you declare, i set a negative polarity
         (-cleft:j) 
      2) every tree that has the restrictor in its interface gets a
         positive polarity for that restrictor 
         (+cleft:j) 
      3) we build the automaton as normal, passing the restrictors as
         polarities to be cancelled out

    (restrictor is my terminology until we find something more standard)
    
    BTW: cleft:j doesn't seem to work, but cleft:m does

(2) An alternate solution to (2) is to tie the restrictors to 
    specific literals.  
    
    For example, we could say something like lookAt(e) agent(e
    j):[cleft:j] patient(e m). This way, the generator knows that
    the [cleft:j] restrictor applies only to the lexical items
    that provide the semantics agent(e j).  If we do something
    like this, we won't have to use the polarities for filtering.

    Not yet implemented!

Changes:
- fs syntax is 
   att:val (not att=val) 
   space delimited (no commas)
- mg changes:
  cleft "ce"   category changed from "cl" to "ce"
  cleft "etre" category changed from "v"  to "etre"
  added value cleftEtre
  commented IL, JEAN, etc
- synlex changes:
  changed feature num to gen

The grammar n0Vn1semt.mg associates 45 trees with the class
n0Vn1nonpassivable

The testuite n0Vn1sem.ts lists an example sentence for each of these
45 trees

semlex and synlex specify the lexicon for the words entering in the
n0Vn1sem.ts sentences

looksem specifies the input which should generate all 45
configurations -- it also specifies a feature cleft(j) on which the
ability of GenI to select a certain paraphrase can be tested. When
using it the only output (on all 4 inputs given in looksem) should be:
