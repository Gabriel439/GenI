title: About GenI
---

GenI is a surface realizer for Tree Adjoining Grammars.  Surface
realization can be seen a subtask of natural language generation
(producing natural language utterances, e.g., English texts, out of
abstract inputs).  GenI in particular takes a Feature Based Lexicalized
Tree Adjoining Grammar and an input semantics (a conjunction of first
order terms), and produces the set of sentences associated with the
input semantics by the grammar.  It features a surface realization
library, several optimizations, batch generation mode, and a graphical
debugger written in wxHaskell.

GenI runs on MacOS X, Linux and Windows and like anywhere else that
the Haskell Platform runs on.

It was developed within the TALARIS project and is free software
licensed under the GNU GPL, with dual-licensing available for commercial
purposes.
