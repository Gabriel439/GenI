GenI is a surface realizer for Tree Adjoining Grammars.  Surface
realization can be seen a subtask of natural language generation
(producing natural language utterances, e.g., English texts, out of
abstract inputs).  GenI in particular takes a Feature Based
Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar and an
input semantics (a conjunction of first order terms), and produces the
set of sentences associated with the input semantics by the grammar.  It
features a surface realization library, several optimizations, batch
generation mode, and a graphical debugger written in wxHaskell.  It was
developed within the TALARIS project and is free software licensed under
the GNU GPL, with dual-licensing available for commercial purposes.

Since May 2011, Eric is working with Computational Linguistics Ltd and
SRI international to develop new features for GenI and improve its
scalability and performance for use in an interactive tutoring
application.  Most recently, we have released an long overdue update to
GenI, featuring GHC 7 support, simpler installation, library cleanups,
bugfixes, and a handful of new UI features.

GenI is available on Hackage, and can be installed via cabal-install.
Our most recent release of GenI was version 0.24 (2012-10-19). For more
