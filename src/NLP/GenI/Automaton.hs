-- TODO: I'd love to reuse some other library out there, but Leon P. Smith's
-- Automata library requires us to know before-hand the size of our alphabet,
-- Maybe HaLeX?

-- | This module provides a simple, naive implementation of nondeterministic
--   finite automata (NFA).
--
--   The transition function consists of a 'Map', but there are also accessor
--   function which help you query the automaton without worrying about how
--   it's implemented.
--
--    1.  The states are a list of lists, not just a simple flat list as
--        you might expect.  This allows you to optionally group your
--        states into \"columns\" which is something we use in the
--        GenI polarity automaton optimisation.
--
--    2.  We model the empty an empty transition as the transition on
--        @Nothing@.  All other transitions are @Just@ something.
