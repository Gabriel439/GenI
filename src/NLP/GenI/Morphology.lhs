\chapter{Morphology}
\label{cha:Morphology}

This module handles mostly everything to do with morphology in Geni.
There are two basic tasks: morphological input and output.  
GenI farms out morphology to whatever third party program you
specify in the configuration file.

\begin{code}
module NLP.GenI.Morphology where
\end{code}

\ignore{
\begin{code}
import Data.Maybe (isNothing)
import Data.List (intersperse)
import Data.Tree
import qualified Data.Map as Map
import System.IO
import System.Process

import NLP.GenI.Btypes
import NLP.GenI.General
import NLP.GenI.Tags
\end{code}
}

\begin{code}
type MorphFn = Pred -> Maybe Flist
\end{code}

\section{Input}

Morphological input means attaching morphological features on trees.  The
user specifies morphological input through the input semantics.  Our job
is to identify morphological predicates like \semexpr{plural(x)} and 
apply features like \fs{\it num:pl} on the relevant trees.

\paragraph{readMorph} converts information from a morphological
information file into GenI's internal format.

\begin{code}
readMorph :: [(String,[AvPair])] -> MorphFn
readMorph minfo pred_ = Map.lookup key fm
  where fm = Map.fromList minfo
        key = show $ snd3 pred_
\end{code}

\fnlabel{stripMorphSem} filters away from an input semantics any
literals whose realisation is strictly morphological.  The first
argument tells us helps identify the morphological literals --
it associates literals with morphological stuff; if it returns
Nothing, then it is non-morphological 

\begin{code}
stripMorphSem :: MorphFn -> Sem -> Sem
stripMorphSem morphfn tsem = 
  [ l | l <- tsem, (isNothing.morphfn) l ]
\end{code}

\paragraph{attachMorph} does the bulk of the morphological input. We use
\fnparam{morphfn} to determine which literals in \fnparam{sem} contain
morphological information and what information they contain.  Then we
attach this morphological information to the relevant trees in
\fnparam{cand}.  A tree is considered relevant w.r.t to a morphological
literal if its semantics contains at least one literal whose first index
is the same as the first index of the morphological literal.

\begin{code}
attachMorph :: MorphFn -> Sem -> [TagElem] -> [TagElem]
attachMorph morphfn sem cands = 
  let -- relevance of a tree wrt to an index
      relTree i = not.null.relfilt.tsemantics
        where relfilt = filter (relLit i)  
      relLit i l = if null args then False else (head args == i)
        where args = thd3 l
      -- perform the attachment for a tree if it is relevant
      attachHelper :: GeniVal -> Flist -> TagElem -> TagElem  
      attachHelper i mfs t = 
        if relTree i t then attachMorphHelper mfs t else t 
      -- perform all attachments for a literal
      attach :: Pred -> [TagElem] -> [TagElem]
      attach l cs = 
        case morphfn l of 
          Nothing  -> cs
          Just mfs -> map (attachHelper i mfs) cs
        where i = if null args then GAnon else head args
              args = thd3 l 
  in foldr attach cands sem 
\end{code}

\paragraph{attachMorphHelper} performs the morphological attachment
proper.  

FIXME: we'll need to make sure this still works as promised 
       when we implement co-anchors.

\begin{code}
attachMorphHelper :: Flist -> TagElem -> TagElem
attachMorphHelper mfs te = 
  let -- unification with anchor
      tt     = ttree te 
      anchor = head $ filterTree fn tt
               where fn a = (ganchor a && gtype a == Lex)
  in case unifyFeat mfs (gup anchor) of
     Nothing -> error ("Morphological unification failure on " ++ idname te)
     Just (unf,subst) ->
      let -- perform replacements
          te2 = replace subst te 
          tt2 = ttree te2
          -- replace the anchor with the unification results
          newgdown = replace subst (gdown anchor) 
          newa = anchor { gup = unf, gdown = newgdown }
      in te2 { ttree = setMorphAnchor newa tt2 }

setMorphAnchor :: GNode -> Tree GNode -> Tree GNode
setMorphAnchor n t =
  let filt (Node a _) = (gtype a == Lex && ganchor a)
      fn (Node _ l)   = Node n l
  in (head.fst) $ listRepNode fn filt [t]
\end{code}

\section{Output}

Output (\jargon{morphological generation}) refers to the actual process
of converting lemmas and morphological information into inflected forms.
We do this by calling some third party software specified by the user.

The morphological software must accept on stdin a newline delimited list
of lemmas and features, with \verb$----$ (four hyphens) as an intersentence
delimiter:

\begin{verbatim}
le       [num:sg gen:f]
fille    [num:sg]
detester [num:sg tense:past]
le       [num:pl gen:m]
garcon   [num:pl]
----     []
ce       []
etre     []
le       [num:pl]
garcon   [num:pl]
que      []
le       [num:sg gen:f]
fille    [num:sg] 
detester [num:sg tense:past]
\end{verbatim}

It must return inflected forms on stdout, \emph{sentences} delimited by
newlines.  Notice that the morphological generator can choose to delete
spaces or do other orthographical tricks in between words:

\begin{verbatim}
la fille detestait les garcons
c'est les garcons que la fille detestait
\end{verbatim}

If your morphological software does not do this, you could wrap it
with a simple shell or Perl script.

\paragraph{sansMorph} extracts the lemmas from a list of uninflected
sentences.  This is used when the morphological generator is 
unavailable, doesn't work, etc.

\begin{code}
sansMorph :: [(String,Flist)] -> String
sansMorph s = (unwords . (map fst)) s
\end{code}

\paragraph{inflectSentences} converts a list of uninflected sentences
into inflected ones by calling the third party software.  Since we're
using system calls, we're stuck with an IO monad. 

\begin{code}
inflectSentences :: String -> [[(String,Flist)]] -> IO [String]
inflectSentences morphcmd sentences =  
  do -- add intersential delimiters
     let delim    = [("----",[])]
         morphlst = concat (intersperse delim sentences)
     -- format the stuff as input to the inflector
     let fn (lem,fs) = lem ++ " [" ++ showPairs fs ++ "]"
         order = unlines $ map fn morphlst 
     -- run the inflector
     (fromP, toP, _, pid) <- runInteractiveCommand morphcmd 
     hPutStrLn toP order
     hClose toP 
     waitForProcess pid 
     -- read the inflector output back as a list of strings
     res <- hGetContents fromP 
     let sentences2 = map trim $ lines res
     --
     return sentences2
  `catch` \_ -> do putStrLn "Error calling morphological generator"
                   return $ map sansMorph sentences
\end{code}
