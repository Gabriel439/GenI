\chapter{SysGeni}

The SysGeni module handles everything which is related to interaction with the
operating system.

\begin{code}
module SysGeni 
where
\end{code}

\ignore{
\begin{code}
import System.Posix
import System.IO(Handle, BufferMode(..), hSetBuffering)
import System.Directory(setCurrentDirectory)
\end{code}
}

\paragraph{runPiped}

To run a command, we implement a simple function to fork the process and make a
system call to the command in the child process.  Note, I stole this function
from DaVinci.hs by Sven Panne.  Also, there is a much simpler
\texttt{runProcess} function in the Posix package, but it doesn't return a pid
for us to wait on.

\begin{code}
runPiped :: FilePath                        -- Command
         -> [String]                        -- Arguments
         -> Maybe [(String, String)]        -- Environment
         -> Maybe FilePath                  -- Working directory    
         -> IO (ProcessID, Handle, Handle)  -- (pid, fromChild, toChild)
\end{code}

\begin{code}
runPiped path args env dir = do
   (rd1, wd1) <- createPipe
   (rd2, wd2) <- createPipe
   let childWork = do maybe (return ()) setCurrentDirectory dir
                      dupTo rd1 stdInput 
                      dupTo wd2 stdOutput 
                      mapM_ closeFd [rd1, wd1, rd2, wd2]
                      executeFile path True args env
                      ioError (userError "runPiped")

       parentWork pid = do -- parent
                           mapM_ closeFd [rd1, wd2]
                           fromChild <- fdToHandle rd2
                           toChild   <- fdToHandle wd1
                           hSetBuffering fromChild LineBuffering
                           hSetBuffering toChild   LineBuffering
                           return (pid, fromChild, toChild)
   do pid <- forkProcess childWork
      parentWork pid 
\end{code} 

Waits for a process to finish.  I don't really understand all this process
stuff, but i suspect this is blocking.

\begin{code}
awaitProcess :: ProcessID -> IO () 
awaitProcess pid = do 
      getProcessStatus False True pid 
      return ()
\end{code}
