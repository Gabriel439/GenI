\chapter{Converter}

This module is meant to act as a standalone program which serves
strictly as a converter between the formats recognised by GenI.  The
current use is to experiment with the idea that the yacc parser for
GeniHand might be much faster than that for the TAGML format, so we
try to see if converting from TAGML to GeniHand is worthwhile.

\begin{code}
module Main (main) where
\end{code}

\ignore{
\begin{code}
import Data.FiniteMap
import Monad(when)
import System (ExitCode(ExitFailure), 
               exitWith, getArgs, getProgName)
import System.IO(getContents)

import Btypes (ifamname, iword, icategory, MTtree)
import GrammarXml (parseXmlTrees, parseXmlGrammar, parseXmlLexicon)
import Treeprint (toGeniHand)
\end{code}
}

\begin{code}
main :: IO ()
main = do       
  -- we take one argument: a switch telling what to convert 
  args <- getArgs
  progname <- getProgName
  let usage p = "usage: " ++ p ++ " [--macros|--trees] < input > output"
      showusage = do putStrLn (usage progname)
                     exitWith (ExitFailure 1)
  when (length args /= 1) showusage
  let filetype = head args
  case filetype of 
    "--macros"   -> convertMacros 
    "--trees"    -> convertTrees
    "--lexicon"  -> convertLexicon
    _            -> showusage
\end{code}

We know how to convert three things
\begin{enumerate}
\item lexicon - a TAGML lexicon (unofficial and unused)
\item macros  - a macros file of unanchored trees
\item trees   - the output of a tree anchoring module (section \ref{sec:cgm_selection})
\end{enumerate}

\begin{code}
convertLexicon :: IO ()
convertLexicon = 
  do lf <- getContents 
     let lex = parseXmlLexicon lf
         showlex l = (iword l) 
                     ++ " " ++ (icategory l) ++ "\n"
                     ++ " " ++ (ifamname l) ++ "\n"
         outstr    = concatMap showlex lex
     putStr outstr 

convertTrees :: IO ()
convertTrees = 
  do gf <- getContents 
     let g = parseXmlTrees gf
         showfn = uncurry showfam 
     putStr (concatMap showfn g)

convertMacros :: IO ()
convertMacros = 
  do gf <- getContents 
     let g = parseXmlGrammar gf 
         showfn f = showfam f (lookupWithDefaultFM g [] f)
         outstr = concatMap showfn (keysFM g)
     putStr outstr

showfam :: String -> [MTtree] -> String
showfam f t = "\n\n" 
              ++ "% ----------------------------------------------------------------------"
              ++ "\n" ++ "begin family " ++ f ++ "\n"
              ++ "% ----------------------------------------------------------------------"
              ++ "\n\n" ++ (concatMap toGeniHand t)
              ++ "end family\n"
\end{code}
