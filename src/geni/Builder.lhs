\chapter{Builder}
\label{cha:Builder}

This module provides an interface to the various back-ends that GenI 
provides.  

Part of the problem is this conflict between wanting to make black
boxes out of stuff and wanting to be able to inspect it with the
graphical interface.  So this stuff isn't really worked out very
well yet.

\begin{code}
module Builder 
where
\end{code}

\ignore{
\begin{code}
import Control.Monad.State

import Automaton (NFA)
import Btypes    (ILexEntry, SemInput, Flist)
import Tags      (TagElem)
\end{code}
}

All backends provide the same essential functionality:
\begin{description}
\item [run]       calls init and stepAll and potentially wraps it with some
                  other functionality.  
\item [init]      initialise the machine from the semantics and lexical selection 
\item [step]      run a realisation step
\item [stepAll]   run all realisations steps until completion
\item [finished]  determine if realisation is finished
\item [stats]     extract various statistics from it
\item [setStats]  set the statistical information 
\item [unpack]    unpack chart results into a list of sentences
\end{description}

\begin{code}
data Builder st it pa = Builder
  { init     :: Input -> pa -> st
  --
  , step     :: State st ()
  , stepAll  :: State st ()
  , run      :: Input -> pa -> st 
  --
  , finished :: st -> Bool
  , stats    :: st -> Gstats
  , setStats :: Gstats -> st -> st 
  , unpack   :: st -> [UninflectedSentence] }
\end{code}

\begin{code}
data BuilderGui = BuilderGui
  { generateGui :: IO ()
  , debugGui    :: IO () }
\end{code}

To simplify interaction with the backend, we provide a single data
structure which represents all the inputs a backend could take.

\begin{code}
data Input = 
  Input { inSemInput :: SemInput
        , inLex      :: [ILexEntry]  -- debugger
        , inCands    :: [TagElem] }
\end{code}

\section{Using builders}

\fnlabel{defaultStepAll} provides a default implementation for
Builder's \fnlabel{stepAll} function.

\begin{code}
defaultStepAll :: Builder st it pa -> (State st ())
defaultStepAll b = 
 do s <- get
    unless (finished b s) $ 
      do step b
         defaultStepAll b
\end{code}

\section{Uninflected words and sentences}

Each word of an uninflected sentence consists of a lemma and some
feature structures.

\paragraph 
A SentenceAut represents a set of sentences in the form of an automaton.
The labels of the automaton are the words of the sentence.  But note! 
``word'' in the sentence is in fact a tuple (lemma, inflectional feature
structures).  Normally, the states are defined as integers, with the
only requirement being that each one, naturally enough, is unique.

\begin{code}
type UninflectedWord        = (String, Flist)
type UninflectedSentence    = [ UninflectedWord ] 
type UninflectedDisjunction = ([String], Flist)
type SentenceAut            = NFA Int UninflectedWord 
\end{code}

\section{Statistics}

These numbers allow us to keep track of how efficient our generator is
and where we are in the process (how many steps we've taken, etc)

\begin{code}
data Gstats = Gstats {
  szchart   :: Int,
  numcompar :: Int,
  geniter   :: Int
} deriving Show


initGstats :: Gstats 
initGstats = Gstats {
  szchart   = 0, 
  numcompar = 0,
  geniter   = 0
}

addGstats :: Gstats -> Gstats -> Gstats
addGstats a b = Gstats {
    szchart   = (szchart a) + (szchart b),
    numcompar = (numcompar a) + (numcompar b),
    geniter   = (geniter a) + (geniter b)
  }

avgGstats :: [Gstats] -> Gstats
avgGstats lst = 
 s { szchart   = (szchart s) `div` len,
     numcompar = (numcompar s) `div` len,
     geniter   = (geniter s) `div` len }
 where s = foldr addGstats initGstats lst
       len = length lst

modifyStats :: Builder st it pa -> (Gstats -> Gstats) -> State st ()
modifyStats b fn =
 do s <- get
    let oldstats = stats b s
        newstats = fn oldstats
    put (setStats b newstats s)

incrGeniter :: Builder st it pa -> Int -> State st ()
incrGeniter b n = 
  modifyStats b (\s -> s { geniter = (geniter s) + n } )
    
incrSzchart :: Builder st it pa -> Int -> State st ()
incrSzchart b n = do
  modifyStats b (\s -> s { szchart = (szchart s) + n } )

incrNumcompar :: Builder st it pa -> Int -> State st ()
incrNumcompar b n = do
  modifyStats b (\s -> s { numcompar = (numcompar s) + n })
\end{code}
