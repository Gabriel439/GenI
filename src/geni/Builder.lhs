\chapter{Builder}
\label{cha:Builder}

This module provides an interface to the various back-ends that GenI 
provides.  

Part of the problem is this conflict between wanting to make black
boxes out of stuff and wanting to be able to inspect it with the
graphical interface.  So this stuff isn't really worked out very
well yet.

\begin{code}
module Builder 
where
\end{code}

\ignore{
\begin{code}
import Control.Monad.State

import Btypes (Sem)
import Configuration (Params)
import Tags (TagElem)
\end{code}
}

All backends provide the same essential functionality:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Something to initialise the machine from a set o
\item 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{code}
data Builder st it = Builder
  { init     :: Sem -> [TagElem] -> Params -> st
  , step     :: State st [it] 
  , finished :: st -> Bool
  , stats    :: st -> Gstats
  , setStats :: Gstats -> st -> st }
\end{code}

\section{Using builders}

\fnlabel{run} recursively steps through the builder until its stopping
condition has been reached.  It returns the results from each step.

\begin{code}
run :: Builder st it -> (State st [it])
run b = 
 do s <- get
    if (finished b) s
       then return []
       else do res  <- (step b)
               next <- (run b)
               return (res ++ next)
\end{code}

\section{Statistics}

These numbers allow us to keep track of how efficient our generator is
and where we are in the process (how many steps we've taken, etc)

\begin{code}
data Gstats = Gstats {
  szchart   :: Int,
  numcompar :: Int,
  geniter   :: Int
} deriving Show


initGstats :: Gstats 
initGstats = Gstats {
  szchart   = 0, 
  numcompar = 0,
  geniter   = 0
}

addGstats :: Gstats -> Gstats -> Gstats
addGstats a b = Gstats {
    szchart   = (szchart a) + (szchart b),
    numcompar = (numcompar a) + (numcompar b),
    geniter   = (geniter a) + (geniter b)
  }

avgGstats :: [Gstats] -> Gstats
avgGstats lst = 
 s { szchart   = (szchart s) `div` len,
     numcompar = (numcompar s) `div` len,
     geniter   = (geniter s) `div` len }
 where s = foldr addGstats initGstats lst
       len = length lst

modifyStats :: Builder st it -> (Gstats -> Gstats) -> State st ()
modifyStats b fn =
 do s <- get
    let oldstats = stats b s
        newstats = fn oldstats
    put (setStats b newstats s)

incrGeniter :: Builder st it -> Int -> State st ()
incrGeniter b n = 
  modifyStats b (\s -> s { geniter = (geniter s) + n } )
    
incrSzchart :: Builder st it -> Int -> State st ()
incrSzchart b n = do
  modifyStats b (\s -> s { szchart = (szchart s) + n } )

incrNumcompar :: Builder st it -> Int -> State st ()
incrNumcompar b n = do
  modifyStats b (\s -> s { numcompar = (numcompar s) + n })
\end{code}
