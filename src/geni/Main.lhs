\chapter{Main}

Welcome to the GenI source code.  The main module is where everything
starts from.  If you're trying to figure out how GenI works, the main
action is in Geni and Tags 
(chapters \ref{cha:Geni} and \ref{cha:Tags}).  

This module's sole job is to decide between the text/graphical 
interface.

\begin{code}
module Main (main) where
\end{code}

\ignore{
\begin{code}
import Data.IORef(readIORef)

import Geni(initGeni, pa)
import Gui(guiGenerate)
import Console(consoleGenerate)
import Configuration(isGraphical, isBatch)
\end{code}

TODO 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define what is and what is not exported from the modules.  
      In particular in BTypes take care to export the inspection function 
      but not the types.
      Re-write functions in Main as needed.
\item Change input in Lexicon and Grammar to allow more than one anchor.
\item Keys used in Tags are specially bad for Pn, perhaps they can be improved.
\end{enumerate}
}

\begin{code}
main :: IO ()
main = do       
  pst <- initGeni
  mst <- readIORef pst
  let headPa   = pa mst
  let notBatch  = not (isBatch headPa)
      graphical = isGraphical headPa
  if (graphical && notBatch) 
     then guiGenerate pst
     else consoleGenerate pst
\end{code}
