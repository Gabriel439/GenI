Documentation
-------------
1. [users manual](http://projects.haskell.org/GenI/manual)
2. [API](http://projects.haskell.org/GenI/api-doc)

Installing GenI
---------------
(tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS X)

see INSTALL for details (should just be cabal install)

Development
-----------
The code style has evolved a lot.  Sorry for the inconsistency.  As of
2012-05-06, I'm trying to move to a [published style guide][style] so I
can stop thinking about silly things like indentation, but the code will
take a long time to catch up.

Please let us know if you are using GenI; we'd like to hear about your
experiences, both positive and negative.
