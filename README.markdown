[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kowey/GenI.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kowey/GenI)

Documentation
-------------
1. [homepage](http://kowey.github.com/GenI) and [wiki][wiki]
2. [manual][manual]
3. [API][API]

Installing GenI
---------------
(tested on Linux, Windows, and MacOS X)

Install the basic version first

    cabal install

Try installing the graphical interface

    cabal install ./geni-gui

You may run into some trouble with wxHaskell.
Get in touch if that's the case.

Development
-----------
* [Darcs (MAIN)][geni-darcs] or [Git (mirror)][geni-github]
* [Issue tracker][issues]

I accept Darcs patches and GitHub pull requests.

The code style has evolved a lot.  Sorry for the inconsistency. As of
2012-05-06, I'm trying to move to a [published style guide][style] so I
can stop thinking about silly things like indentation, but the code will
take a long time to catch up.
