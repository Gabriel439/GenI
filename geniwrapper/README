This is a simple wrapper to demonstrate the possibility of integrating
GenI as a library in a piece of non-Haskell software.

It provides an example C program showing how such a wrapper might be
used.

The wrapper is minimalistic.  It only provides functions to start GenI;
run it on an tree schemata, lexicon and input semantics triplet; and to
shut it down.

See the foreign exports in MinimalGenI.hs for a list of wrapper
functions you can call from your C code.

For Windows users, it demonstrates building GenI into a standalone
Windows DLL and calling it from there.

The Makefile uses tools from MingW, but you could also just run the
commands by hand.
