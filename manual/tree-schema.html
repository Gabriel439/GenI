<p>This module provides basic datatypes specific to Tree Adjoining Grammar tree schemata.</p>
<h2 id="tree-schemata-1">Tree schemata</h2>
<p>In GenI, the tree schemata are called ‘macros’ for historical reasons. We are working to phase out this name in favour of the more standard ‘tree schema(ta)’.</p>

<p>A TAG node may have a category. In the core GenI algorithm, there is nothing which distinguishes the category from any other attributes. But for some other uses, such as checking if it is a result or for display purposes, we do treat this attribute differently. We take here the convention that the category of a node is associated to the attribute “cat”.</p>
<p>A TAG node might also have a lexeme. If we are lucky, this is explicitly set in the glexeme field of the node. Otherwise, we try to guess it from a list of distinguished attributes (in order of preference).</p>
<h3 id="pretty-printing">Pretty printing</h3>
<p>The default show for GNode tries to be very compact; it only shows the value for cat attribute and any flags which are marked on that node.</p>
