        <p>Lexical filtering is a feature which allows the user to constrain the lexical selection to only those items that contain a certain property, for example, the realising an item as a cleft.</p>
<p>The idea is that the user provides an input like <code>idxconstraints:[cleft:j]</code>, which means that the lexical selection must include exactly one tree with the property cleft:j in its interface. This mechanism works as pre-processing step after lexical selection and before polarity automaton construction, in conjuction with the ExtraPolarities mechanism. What we do is</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Preprocess the lexically selected trees; any tree which has a a desired property (e.g. <code>cleft:j</code>) in its interface is assigned a positive polarity for that property (<code>+cleft:j</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Add all the index constraints as negative extra polarities (<code>-cleft:j</code>)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: To use lexical filtering, <a href="polarity.html">polarity filtering</a> must be enabled.</p>
