{- | Graphviz is an open source tool which converts an abstract
     representation of a graph (node foo is connected to node bar, etc.)
     into a nicely laid out graphic.  This module contains methods 
     to invoke graphviz and to convert graphs and trees to its input format.

     You can download this (open source) tool at
     <http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz>

     Data structures which can be visualised with GraphViz should
     implement this class.  Note the first argument to graphvizShowGraph is
     so that you can parameterise your show function (i.e. pass in
     flags to change the way you show particular object).  Note
     that by default, all graphs are treated as directed graphs.  You
     can hide this by turning off edge arrows.

{- Note that we could make this an
   instance of GraphvizShow, but I'm not too sure about the wisdom of
   such a move.  

   Maybe if we had some really super-sophisticated types in Haskell, where
   we can define this as the default instance which could be overrided by
   something more specific, that would be cool.

   The prefix argument is interpreted as the name of the top node.  Node
   names below are basically Gorn addresses (e.g. n0x2x3 means 3rd child of
   the 2nd child of the root) to keep them distinct.  Note : We use the
   letter `x' as seperator because graphviz will choke on `.' or `-', even
   underscore. -}
