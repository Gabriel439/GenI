GenI 0.17.3, 3 Apr 2009
-----------------------
* Simplified build method
  * one single cabal package instead of two
  * cabal configure -f-gui to disable GUI
  * makefile stripped out

* Lexical selection on empty semantics now allowed
  * This is so that the zero-literal semantics mechanism can work again
