GenI 0.22, XX
----------------------
- NEW FEATURES AND UI CHANGES

  * GHC 7.0.3 or higher required (Haskell Platform preferred)
  * Simpler install : geni and geni-gui are now separate executables
  * --batchdir now optional (GenI creates a default temporary directory
    if you don't specify one)
  * New logging mechanism (not extensively used yet)
  * Polarity filtering no longer requires all subst/root nodes to have
    the feature defined.
  * New input tab for graphical generation
  * Capping results
    * --maxsteps to cap each test case at a certain number of chart
                 generation steps
    * --maxresults
  * More compact warnings output
  * The following optimisations are now obligatory
    - early null-adjunction detection
    - semantic filter (for 2-phase realisation)
  * Faster lexical selection
    - duplicates trimed
    - singleton variables are anonymised
  * Make '-r' a short command line option for '--rootfeat'.
  * Tree schemata support “fancy” disjunctions of unification variables
    These are not atomic disjunctions, but they will be squashed upon
    lexical selection
  * New time metric for statistics collection

- LIBRARY CHANGES

  * Somewhat safer and easier to navigate API
  * Customisable arbitrary lexical selection action
  * Customisable arbitrary morpholical realiser action

- NEW TOOLS

  * geniserver is now an HTTP server (and a library so you can write
    your own geni-based web servers)
  * genireport provides a summary of test suite results

- BUGFIXES

  * Do top/bottom unification on na-constrained nodes during initialisation.
  * Avoid accepting 'aconstr:noadj' as an attribute.
  * #33 - Make the root feature flag required, with no defaults.
  * #39: reject malformed root feature input.
  * #49 - correct order that leaf nodes are returned.
  * one-tree results now have derivation trees

GenI 0.20, 29 Sep 2009
----------------------
- NON BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE CHANGES

  * GHC 6.8 or higher now required (GHC 6.10 + Haskell Platform preferred)
  * Input files now *assumed* to be UTF-8 encoded
    (output still ISO8859-1; hopefully locale-based in GHC 6.12)
  * Interface between GenI and morphological realiser now uses a JSON format.
  * Rootfeat optimisation now mandatory (flag no longer recognised)

- NEW FUNCTIONALITY

  * new flag --version now works and reports version from Cabal file
  * new flag --dump dumps derivation output to stdout in JSON format
  * new flag --ranking foo ranks outputs according to OT-style constraints expressed in foo
  * --batchdir now works with --testcase
  * --batchdir now dumps derivations and statistics in JSON format
  * --batchdir now works with instructions files
  * --metrics always expands 'default' to the default metrics
    (in addition to any other statistics you request)
  * new optimisation: early null-adjunction detection

- QUALITY ASSURANCE

  * Reference manual in docs/genimanual.pdf (make docs)
  * cabal install -fgui and cabal install produce the same underlying library
    only the executable is different
  * Easier GUI installation for MacOS X (application bundles now built
    automatically; no manual intervention required)
  * Adopted odd/even convention to distinguish devel builds from stable ones
    (eg. GenI 0.21.x is devel whereas GenI 0.20.x is stable)

GenI 0.17.4, 6 Apr 2009
-----------------------
* GHC 6.6 support

* GUI disabled by default

GenI 0.17.3, 3 Apr 2009
-----------------------
* Simplified build method
  * one single cabal package instead of two
  * cabal configure -f-gui to disable GUI
  * makefile stripped out

* Lexical selection on empty semantics now allowed
  * This is so that the zero-literal semantics mechanism can work again

* Better help text

* Baked-in unit testing (geni --unit-test)

GenI 0.10, 11 Dec 2006
----------------------
* Performance much improved after Haskell profiling
* Pre-compiled grammars option, geniserver (buggy)

GenI 0.9, 8 Dec 2006
--------------------
* Switched to new syntax: variables now must be prefixed with '?'
* Switched from Alex/Happy to Parsec
* Added API documentation via haddock

GenI 0.8, 16 Sep 2005
---------------------
* Support for latin-1 characters using Unicode wxhaskell
* Added a configure script and an install target in Makefile
* Changed from use of configuration files to use of command line switches
* Full configuration GUI
* Implementation of atomic disjunction
* --ignore-semantics mode (Jackie Lai)

GenI 0.7, 8 June 2005
---------------------
* Upgraded to ghc 6.4, wxwidgets 2.6, wxhaskell 0.9.4

GenI 0.6, 3 May 2005
---------------------
* User interface fixes (Window size bugs)
* Interface with Yannick Parmientier's selection module
