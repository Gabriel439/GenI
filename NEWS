GenI 0.19,
-----------------------
- NEW REQUIREMENTS

  * GHC 6.8 or higher (GHC 6.10 + Haskell Platform preferred)

- NON BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE CHANGES:

  * Input files now *assumed* to be UTF-8 encoded.
    Previously we assumed they were ISO-8859-1.

    Unfortunately, GenI still outputs ISO-8859-1 by default,
    except when generating JSON (all non-ASCII characters are
    escaped).  If you compile GenI with GHC 6.12 the output
    encoding will be locale-dependent.

  * Interface between GenI and morphological realiser now uses a JSON format.

- NEW FUNCTIONALITY

  * --version now works and reports version from Cabal file
    NB: we now follow the odd-even convention, so eg GenI-0.20 is considered
    stable, whereas GenI-0.21 is considered to be a development version.
  * --ranking foo ranks outputs according to OT-style constraints expressed in foo
  * --batchdir now works with --testcase
  * --batchdir now dumps derivations and statistics in JSON format
  * console mode accepts 'instructions' files
  * --metrics always expands 'default' to the default metrics (in addition to
    any other statistics you request)

GenI 0.17.4, 6 Apr 2009
-----------------------
* GHC 6.6 support

* GUI disabled by default

GenI 0.17.3, 3 Apr 2009
-----------------------
* Simplified build method
  * one single cabal package instead of two
  * cabal configure -f-gui to disable GUI
  * makefile stripped out

* Lexical selection on empty semantics now allowed
  * This is so that the zero-literal semantics mechanism can work again

* Better help text

* Baked-in unit testing (geni --unit-test)

GenI 0.10, 11 Dec 2006
----------------------
* Performance much improved after Haskell profiling
