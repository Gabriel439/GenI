first make sure you have these things installed
 - ghc 6.2   (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
 - WxWidgets 2.4.2 (for WxHaskell)

there's also a few other things to install, but rather than fetching 
them yourself, just use curl!

  mkdir /tmp/genidl
  cd /tmp/genidl
  cp /WHATEVER/Geni/etc/geni.curl .
  curl -K geni.curl

then install all of the packages that get downloaded:
the downloaded packages should include:
 - Happy     1.13 (yacc for haskell)
 - Alex      (lex for haskell)
 - WxHaskell 0.6 (graphics)
 - HaXML     1.12 (for XML processing)
 - graphviz  (for visualisation)
