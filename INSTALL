1) make sure you have these things installed
   - ghc 6.4       (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
   - WxWidgets 2.6 (for GUI)
     * note: already installed on OS X 10.4 (Tiger)

2) there's also a few other things to install, but rather than fetching 
them yourself, just use curl!

  mkdir /tmp/genidl
  cd /tmp/genidl
  cp /WHATEVER/Geni/etc/geni.curl .
  curl -K geni.curl

3) then install all of the packages that get downloaded:
the downloaded packages should include:
 - Happy     1.13  (yacc for haskell)
 - Alex      2.0   (lex for haskell)
 - WxHaskell 0.9.4 (graphics)
 - graphviz  (for visualisation)
